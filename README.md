# prjSnek : Kam-Ch
My second python snek with awful graphics taken from free png and cut in paint
First time using pygames 

# Sound credit
Music: https://www.bensound.com

# You need to install pygames
if you have python installed in your computer, go to your terminal or your invite command
type : pip install pygames

# To my fellow beginner friends
I suggest that you check the code understand it and try to do this project on your own
It has so many challenges that you will love taking on and you will learn a lot once it is achieved
If you have any questions regarding the code or vectors or anything, I'll be glad to answer them

# To my master coders friends
I wanted to make something simple to read, understand and efficent, so!
If you see any place for improvement, please, reach out :)


# Updates

Snek has good graphics (considering my paint talents..) and fruit is working properly

Future updates:

v1.2 taking off teh borders and making the snake teleport from one border to the other
