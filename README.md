# You need to install pygames
if you have python installed in your computer, go to your terminal or your invite command  
type : pip install pygames

# To my fellow beginner friends
I suggest that you check the code understand it and try to do this project on your own  
It has so many challenges that you will love taking on and you will learn a lot once it is achieved  
If you have any questions regarding the code or vectors or anything, I'll be glad to answer them  

# To my master coders friends
I wanted to make something simple to read, understand and efficent, so!  
If you see any place for improvement, please, reach out :)


# Updates
- Snek has good graphics (considering my paint talents..) and fruit is working properly
- Added a list of fruits now (3 fruits that show at random)
- Added a background sound, eating sound and gameover sound
- Added feature: snake stays still at the begining of each game until a direction is given instead of going right automatically
- Added feature: game doesn't close when gameover, it only resets at the starting position

Future updates:
- A proper menu
- Toggle on/off background music from menu
- Top 3 scores from menu (txt? csv?)
- Taking off the borders and making the snake teleport from one border to the other
